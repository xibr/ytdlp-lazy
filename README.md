# ytdlp-lazy

Starting with release [2022.08.14](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2022.08.14) of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [0.13.3](https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android/releases/tag/0.13.3) of [youtubedl-android](https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android) we are no longer using this repo to build yt-dlp for [youtubedl-android](https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android), (We may build yt-dlp for older versions of youtubedl-android if things are broken).

Thanks to [pukkandan](https://github.com/pukkandan) who made this possible, See [#1](https://github.com/xibr/ytdlp-lazy/issues/1)

Also lazy extractor is enabled in releases at [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), See [[build] Enable lazy-extractors in releases](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/6e21fdd27902efa6ad7fb12b570e4b2dd0bfde8d).
